				<h4> Steps</h4>
				<ol>
					<li> Wash and slice the potatoes: Start by thoroughly washing the potatoes to remove any dirt or debris. Then, using a sharp knife or a mandoline slicer, thinly slice the potatoes into uniform slices, about 1/8 to 1/16 inch thick. Try to make the slices as consistent as possible for even frying. </li>
					<li>  Rinse and dry the potato slices: Place the sliced potatoes in a bowl of cold water to rinse off excess starch. This step helps achieve crispier chips. After rinsing, pat the slices dry with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels to remove any moisture.</li>
					
					<li> Fry the potato chips: Heat vegetable oil in a deep saucepan or deep-fryer to about 350°F (175°C). Working in batches, carefully add a handful of potato slices to the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry the chips for 3-5 minutes or until they turn golden brown and crispy. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking.</li>
					<li> Remove and drain the chips: Once the chips are golden brown and crispy, use a slotted spoon or tongs to carefully transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate or baking sheet to drain excess oil. Sprinkle the freshly fried chips with salt or any desired seasonings while they are still hot.</li>
					<li> Repeat the process: Continue frying the remaining potato slices in batches until all the chips are cooked. Make sure to bring the oil back to the correct temperature before adding each batch.</li>
					<li> Cool and store: Allow the potato chips to cool completely before transferring them to an airtight container or zip-top bags for storage. Homemade potato chips are best enjoyed fresh but can be stored for a few days.

					<p>Remember to exercise caution while working with hot oil and always follow proper safety guidelines when deep-frying. </p>
